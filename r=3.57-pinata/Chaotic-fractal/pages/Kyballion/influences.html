  <h1>Influences and Legacy of The Kybalion</h1>

  <section id="hermeticism">
    <h2>Hermeticism as the Core Foundation</h2>
    <p>
      The Kybalion is deeply rooted in the hermetic teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure credited
      with bridging ancient Egyptian wisdom and Greek philosophy. Hermeticism provided the framework for many spiritual
      and mystical traditions by emphasizing universal laws connecting the material and spiritual realms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifically, The Kybalion distills these teachings into seven core principles, making them accessible to
      modern readers while preserving their esoteric origins.

    <h2>Impact on Western Philosophy and Esotericism</h2>
    <p>
      Since its publication in 1908, The Kybalion has left a profound mark on Western esoteric traditions. It
      reintroduced themes of mentalism, universal correspondence, and spiritual mastery, which resonate strongly with
      metaphysical and philosophical currents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern movements, such as New Thought, the Theosophical Society, and self-help philosophies, often draw upon
      concepts first articulated in hermetic traditions and simplified by The Kybalion. Modern authors on topics like
      the "law of attraction" also build upon its principles.
    </p>

  <section id="new-thought">
    <h2>Integration with the New Thought Movement</h2>
    <p>
      The principles of The Kybalion, particularly the idea of mind as the creative force behind all reality,
      align closely with the ideology of the **New Thought movement**. Originating in the 19th and 20th centuries,
      New Thought emphasized positive thinking, mental power, and spiritual self-realization. Many consider The Kybalion
      a reference guide to understanding universal principles within the New Thought philosophy.

  <section id="modern_influence">
    <h2>Modern-Day Spirituality and Popular Culture</h2>
    <p>
      The Kybalion remains influential in contemporary spirituality, often referenced in self-help literature,
      podcasts, and courses on manifestation and metaphysics. Its enduring themes have inspired countless seekers
      to explore the deeper connections between mind, spirit, and the cosmos.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book has also had a subtle yet notable impact on popular culture, influencing works of fiction that delve into mystical or esoteric concepts.
