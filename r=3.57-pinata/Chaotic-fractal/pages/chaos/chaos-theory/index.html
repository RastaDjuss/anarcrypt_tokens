    <h2>What is Chaos Theory?</h2>
    <p>Chaos theory focuses on complex systems where small changes can produce dramatic outcomes. This is famously illustrated by the Butterfly Effect.</p>

    <h2>About Chaos Theory</h2>
    <p>Chaos theory is a scientific field associated with mathematics and physics that examines the behavior of deterministic systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, a phenomenon commonly exemplified by the Butterfly Effect.</p>

    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>Chaos theory studies dynamic systems while seeking to understand how initial conditions affect them. Small changes in starting conditions in such systems can lead to rapidly diverging behavior, making long-term predictions impossible despite their deterministic nature.</p>
    <p>This paradoxical behavior is known as "deterministic chaos" or simply "chaos."</p>

    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <p>Chaotic behavior is fundamental to natural systems, such as weather or climate. It is studied through mathematical models or analytical techniques like recurrence analysis and Poincaré maps. Chaos theory finds applications in meteorology, physics, sociology, computer science, economics, biology, and even philosophy.</p>

    <h2>History of Chaos Theory</h2>
    <p>The origins of chaos theory date back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Henri Poincaré and Mary Lucy Cartwright were among its pioneers. Yet it was not until the 1970s that chaos theory gained significant recognition, partly thanks to advancements in computing that allowed the visualization of chaotic systems.</p>

    <h3>The Butterfly Effect</h3>
    <p>In chaos theory, the Butterfly Effect illustrates how minor variations in initial conditions can vastly affect outcomes. It is often presented metaphorically as a butterfly flapping its wings and causing changes that may lead to a tornado elsewhere.</p>
