    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Chaos Magic (or Chaos Magick) is a modern form of ritual and magical practice that relies on paradigm shifts and altered
      states of consciousness, referred to as "gnosis." These states can be achieved through methods such as meditation, chanting, dancing, the use of drugs, pain, or orgasm, enabling practitioners to sculpt reality according to their intentions.

  <section id="history">
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Austin Osman Spare (1886–1956), initially associated with traditions such as the Golden Dawn, the O.T.O., and Aleister Crowley’s Astrum Argentum, developed independent theories and practices that later influenced the Illuminates of Thanateros. He popularized the use of sigils and ecstatic states as magical tools. The term "Chaos Magick" was widely disseminated by Peter J. Carroll through the publication of <em>Liber Null</em> in 1978, introducing radical concepts to magical practice.

  <!-- The Magical Paradigm Shift -->
  <section id="paradigm-shift">
    <h2>The Magical Paradigm Shift</h2>
    <p>
      The paradigm shift refers to switching belief systems or frameworks depending on the needs of a ritual or intent. For example, a chaos magician might perform a Lovecraftian ritual, followed by using techniques from runic magic. The principle is that belief systems are tools, adaptable at will. The associated slogan is: “Nothing is true, everything is permitted,” illustrating the flexibility and relativity of perceived truths.

  <!-- The State of Gnosis -->
  <section id="gnosis">
    <h2>The State of Gnosis</h2>
    <p>
      Gnosis represents an altered state of consciousness necessary for magical work. In this state, the mind is entirely focused on a single intent or symbol, excluding all other thoughts. Methods to achieve this state vary and include practices such as extreme dancing, deep meditation, or sensory deprivation techniques.

    <h2>Chaos Magicians</h2>
    <p>
      Chaos Magicians (or Chaotes) reject the idea of fixed frameworks or categories. For them, beliefs, traditions, and even personalities are tools. Their goal is to experiment and freely manipulate their environment creatively. To them, magic is an unrestricted means of shaping perceived reality.

  <!-- Symbols and Gods -->
  <section id="symbols-gods">
    <h2>Symbols and Gods</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike classical magical traditions, Chaos Magic does not rely on any specific gods or symbols. Instead, chaos magicians borrow elements from different traditions and combine them as needed. The eight-pointed star (or "chaosphere") is one of the few symbols widely associated with this practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entities invoked include figures from various cultures, such as Tiamat, Eris, or Loki. Chaos magicians may also create temporary, even parodic symbolic systems to explore new magical dimensions.
