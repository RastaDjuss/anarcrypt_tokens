  <section id="hermetic_texts">
    <h2>Ancient Hermetic Texts</h2>
    <p>
      The Kybalion is heavily inspired by ancient Hermetic texts, which are collectively known as the **Hermetica**. These works,
      attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, delve into spiritual, philosophical, and esoteric topics that have deeply influenced
      Western thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Famous texts like the **Corpus Hermeticum** and **The Emerald Tablet** are key foundations for the principles
      articulated in The Kybalion, emphasizing universal laws and the connection between the spiritual and material worlds.

    <h2>Revival During the Renaissance</h2>
    <p>
      During the Renaissance, Hermetic texts were revived by scholars such as **Marsilio Ficino** and **Giordano Bruno**.
      These thinkers reinterpreted ancient esoteric wisdom to align with Renaissance ideals, bridging spirituality,
      science, and philosophy in innovative ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kybalion builds upon this intellectual tradition, simplifying complex teachings to make them accessible to modern seekers
      eager to reconnect with ancient wisdom.
